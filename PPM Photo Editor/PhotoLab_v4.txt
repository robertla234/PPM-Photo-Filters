PhotoLab.txt

In this assignment, we were instructed to convert our previous PhotoLab
assignment from one using arrays to one using structures and pointers. Then,
we were required to add three more filters: Resize, Rotate, and Saturate. 

Converting the old PhotoLab assignment was difficult to say the least. I 
created my Image.h and Image.c files and used the hw3_sol/ copied files as 
a base. I included all the function declarations from the assignment 
slides to change all the .h files. I had to review old lecture slides, refer
to assignment slides, and even Google some information on how to properly
point to a strucutre and its elements. The use of IMAGE *image was so
confusing to begin with. After I figured out how to properly set up both
Image and my FileIO.c files, setting up and replacing the arrays with 
pointers through the DIPs and Advanced functions was easy. Even changing
the temporary arrays in the former functions to new structures cause me
some issue. 

Creating the Resize, Rotate, and Saturate were relatively easy. The 
calculations and formulas for each were included in the assignment slides
so that was easy to follow. One issue is in the Resize. MY SMALL RESIZE
IS BLURRY FROM THE AVERAGE AND MY BIG RESIZE IS FUZZY FROM TRYING TO
DUPLICATE PIXELS. I cannot seem to remedy this so I left it in the 
code. My 500 resize for the big resize is also spotty. Other than that,
the filters seem to work well.

The Valgrind feature is confusing. I was and am unsure how to change my
code in order to fix the errors. I used "valgrind ./PhotoLab" to narrow
down that the errors stem from only the new filters. The old filters
show no errors. I am unsure how to fix the new filters to be in line
with what Valgrind wants.

Overall, this lab was difficult and I have left it somwhat unfinished.
